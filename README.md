# JavaScript-Projects
This repository is for my JavaScript projects

I made several small projectes learning and using a variety of functions. I performed exercises using JQuery, I also worked on a Bootstrap project which incorporated JQuery - [[Academy Cinemas]]([url](https://github.com/JackRM10/Jack-HTML-and-CSS-Projects/blob/main/bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html))
